# RanvierMud-SpinOff
This repo is dedicated to my journey of reproducing a Mud (multi-user-dungeon) back from the 90s.

## About
This reproduction is being implemented by 4 other programmers and since Exile is a currently live game, the source code of the game and this repoduction is held in a private repository.

What **is** included in this repository is the features that I am converting or adding to the reproduction. Each feature that I include, I'll have my goals, obstacles, and process mapped out. I'll also include some snippets.

## Implemented Features
* [Clans](Clans.md)
  * [ClanRanks](ClanRank.md)
